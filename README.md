# MLOps Infrastructure

This repository contains a set of files for deploying an MLOps environment on Kubernetes, with the following services:

- **MLflow**: for model registry.
- **PostgreSQL**: required by MLflow to store metadata.
- **Seldon Core**: for model deployment.
- **Prefect**: for pipeline management.
- **MinIO**: for object storage.
- Maybe **Prometheus** will be added
